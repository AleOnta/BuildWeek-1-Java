# BuildWeek-1-Java

This was the first BackEnd build week of the Epicode Bootcamp that we were given.
The team were supposed to be of 4 collaborators, but due to unclear reasons, only me (AleOnta) and AleBell have worked on this project.
In this project, we were instructed to build a public transport program, bound to a dedicated Database.

The project is built in Java (JDK17) on Eclipse IDE - The database has been built on PostgreSQL (pgAdmin) and some libraries has been added through Maven.
As said before, we were working on this project in two instead of four, and this has engraved on the delivery of the project in time.

We have accomplished everything we were told to build, but we didn't had enough time to properly debug all-around the program.
The Program is available through console in package trasportoRunnable/Runnable.java

I will keep working on this project on my free time.
